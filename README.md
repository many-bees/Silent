Haven't tried this one out myself yet

# Silent Hill 2
### [Silent Hill Texture Explorer](https://www.silenthillmemories.net/sh2/modding_en.htm)
Allows the browsing of various archives to view and extract textures from them. This page also lists a model exporter but it's in .obj format so you're better off just downloading stuff from [Silent Hill Museum](https://silenthillmuseum.org/).

### [Silent Hill Explorer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVf7DRGpgFQgle50gO6HSkozNHjlJVgr/view)
General extraction tool for various files found in Silent Hill 2 & 3. Can be used to get stuff like .mdl files and .adx files from the game but usually other programs are needed to convert those files into a usable form.

### [Psilent pHill 2](https://github.com/pmttavara/ph2/tree/main)
Silent Hill 2 map viewer that allows maps to be exported into .obj format. For some reason when you loaed them into Blender their massive though so scale the mesh down a bunch if you wanna actually see it.

# Silent Hill 3
### [Silent Hill Texture Explorer](https://www.silenthillmemories.net/sh2/modding_en.htm)
Seems to have some problems with SH3 specifically but I'm not sure if that's the program's fault or the game's.

### [Silent Hill Explorer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVf7DRGpgFQgle50gO6HSkozNHjlJVgr/view)
Exports usable files from .arc files

### [SH3_chr](https://github.com/alanm20/SH3_chr/tree/main)
Despite being called a character loader it can also load anything else that's in the .mdl format such as items and weapons.

# Silent Hill 4
### [sh4worldmeshimport](https://github.com/HunterStanton/sh4worldmeshimport)
Blender addon to import .bin files that contain world meshes. Works with the PC version only.

### [Silent Hill Texture Explorer](https://www.silenthillmemories.net/sh2/modding_en.htm)
Site lists it as only working for 2 and 3 but it works for 4 just fine as well. Pretty sure it's PC version only.

### [Silent Hill 4 Noesis Plugin](https://youtu.be/4fNbtRQ7irM)
Only works with .bin files from the xbox version of the game so you'll probably have to download a ROM. Also you have to remove fmt_bin.py from your Noesis plugins folder because it conflicts with this plugin.

I figure everyone here knows how to download Noesis and Blender already and I don't need to list them. Also audio files from these games can be opened and converted with VLC Media Player.
